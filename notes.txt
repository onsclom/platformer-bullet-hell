CORE GAMEPLAY:
- 10 waves
  - each wave has different "level" tiles & enemy combos + frequencies
  - they get progressively harder
  - each wave lasts 60 seconds?
  - end of wave, maybe there's a portal you need to get to?
    - you can stay longer to get more coins, but it gets hard fast
- lives and $ carry between waves
- end of wave, has a wave recap (how much coins you earn)
- after wave recap, it's shop time
- on death or win, give run recap

bullet/enemy ideas:
- wall traveling tank
  - walks along perimeter and shoots straight
- homing missle (slow-ish but homes)
- bullet rain
- random wanderer enemy/bullets?
  - they move with perlin noise?
- tile patterns
  - checkerboard
  - rows / columns checkered
  - area of denial
- circular explosion area of denials
- enemy that aims laser, but rotate towards player somewhat slowly

purchase ideas:
- heal 1 life
- +1 max life
- magnetic coins
- +1 coin on map (2 -> 3 coins on map)
- +1 jump (double jump, etc)
- walljump?
- slow bullet speed
- slow bullet spawn rate
- + player speed
- shrink player hurtbox
- cheaper purchases
- longer invulnerable recovery time
- rotating shield from hollow knight
